# Introduction
- this is a React-based Google Books Search app 
- this app requires a minimum of 2 pages, including a Search page and a Saved page
- this app is deployed to Heroku https://google-book-scraper.herokuapp.com/

## Instructions
- search the title and/or author(s) of the book you're interested in looking at
- a list of results will populate in the results field
- you can View the result to see whether or not it's what you're looking for
- once you've found what you're looking for, you can Save that result
- each saved item will populate on the Saved page for you to view at a later time


## How it works 
1. Start by using the 07-Ins_Mern example as a base for your application.

2. Add code to connect to a MongoDB database named `googlebooks` using the mongoose npm package.

3. Using mongoose, then create a Book schema.

4. At a minimum, books should have each of the following fields:

* `title` - Title of the book from the Google Books API

* `authors` - The books's author(s) as returned from the Google Books API

* `description` - The book's description as returned from the Google Books API

* `image` - The Book's thumbnail image as returned from the Google Books API

* `link` - The Book's information link as returned from the Google Books API

* Creating `documents` in your `books` collection similar to the following:

    ```js
    {
      authors: ["Suzanne Collins"]
      description: "Set in a dark vision of the near future, a terrifying reality TV show is taking place. Twelve boys and twelve girls are forced to appear in a live event called The Hunger Games. There is only one rule: kill or be killed. When sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen steps forward to take her younger sister's place in the games, she sees it as a death sentence. But Katniss has been close to death before. For her, survival is second nature."

      link: "http://books.google.com/books?id=sazytgAACAAJ&dq=title:The+Hunger+Games&hl=&source=gbs_api"
      title: "The Hunger Games"
    }
    ```

5. Create a layout similar to the mockups displayed above. This should be a SPA (Single Page Application) that uses [`react-router-dom`](https://github.com/reactjs/react-router) to navigate, hide and show your React components without changing the route within Express.

* The layout should include at least two React Components for each page `Search` and `Saved`.

* Feel free to try out alternative CSS framework to Bootstrap.

6. Add the following Express routes for your app:

* `/api/books` (get) - Should return all saved books as JSON.

* `/api/books` (post) - Will be used to save a new book to the database.

* `/api/books/:id` (delete) - Will be used to delete a book from the database by Mongo `_id`.

* `*` (get) - Will load your single HTML page in `client/build/index.html`. Make sure you have this _after_ all other routes are defined.
